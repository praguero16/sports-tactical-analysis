##  Features

-  Real-time player and ball detection using **YOLOv8**
-  Object tracking with **SORT (Simple Online Realtime Tracking)**
-  Camera motion estimation and **perspective transformation**
-  Speed and distance calculations of tracked entities
-  Tactical visualizations including:
  - Heatmaps of player movement
  - Ball possession & distribution
  - Mini-court overlay
-  Stub mode for replaying precomputed detections for faster debugging
